## My ALX Low-Level Programming in C

This repository contains a collection of my C programming learnings as part of my journey at ALX AFRICA. Each directory represents a specific topic or concept I have learnt in the program. The following is a brief explanation of each topic:

## Topics Covered

### [0x00: Hello World in C](./0x00-hello_world/)
Introduction to the C programming language which covers the basics of writing a simple "Hello, World!" program.

### [0x01: Variables, if & else, while loop](./0x01-variables_if_else_while/)
Exploration of variables, conditional statements (if & else), and looping constructs (while loop) in C.

### [0x03: Debugging](./0x03-debugging/)
Introduction to debugging techniques in C programming, including the use of debugging tools and strategies for finding and fixing errors in code.

### [0x04: More on Functions & Nested Loop](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/)
In-depth coverage of functions and nested loops in C programming, including function definition, invocation, and usage of nested loops for iterative tasks.

### [0x05, 0x06, 0x07: Pointers, Arrays & Strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
Understanding pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. Topics include pointer arithmetic, array declaration, string manipulation, and memory allocation. Check the three directories covering this topics

### [0x08: Recursion](./0x08-recursion/)
Exploration of recursive function calls in C programming, covering the concept of recursion and its applications in solving problems.

### [0x09: Static Libraries](./0x09-static_libraries/)
Understanding static libraries in C programming. Topics include library creation, linking, and usage in different projects.

### [0x0A: argc argv](./0x0A-argc_argv/)
Explanation of the `argc` and `argv` parameters in the `main` function and their usage for command-line argument processing in C programming.

### [0x0B, 0x0C: malloc free](./0x0B-malloc_free/)
In-depth coverage of dynamic memory allocation in C programming using `malloc` and `free` functions. Topics include memory allocation, deallocation, and memory management.

### [0x0D: Preprocessor](./0x0D-preprocessor/)
Introduction to the C preprocessor and its role in code compilation. Covers preprocessor directives, macro definitions, and conditional compilation.

### [0x0E: Structures, typedef](./0x0E-structures_typedef/)
Understanding structures and the `typedef` keyword in C programming. Topics include structure declaration, member access, and type definitions for enhanced readability.

### [0x0F: Function Pointers](./0x0F-function_pointers/)
Exploration of function pointers in C programming, covering the concept of storing and using pointers to functions.

### [0x10: Variadic Functions](./0x10-variadic functions/)
Understanding variadic functions in C programming, which can accept a variable number of arguments. Covers the use of the `va_list` type and related macros.

### [0x13: More on Singly Linked Lists](./0x13-more_singly_linked_lists/)
In-depth coverage of singly linked lists in C programming. Topics include list creation, traversal, insertion, deletion, and memory management.

### [0x14: Bit Manipulation](./0x14-bit_ manipulation/)
Exploration of bit manipulation techniques in C programming, including bitwise operators and their applications for efficient coding.

### [0x15: File I/O](./0x15-file_io/)
Understanding file input/output operations in C programming. Topics include file handling, reading from and writing to files, and error handling.
